### EXPERIENCE  


Developed a Flask web application utilizing PostgreSQL, HTML page parsing, and Jinja 2 templating; deployed the application in a production environment on the PaaS platform Render.  
Developed chatbots for messengers using an asynchronous approach with AsyncIO, aiohttp, and aiogram, as well as integrated APIs from other services to expand functionality and interaction.  
Deployed a Django project in a production environment on the PaaS platform Railway, using PostgreSQL as the database.  
Worked with asynchronous microservices within a microservice architecture to improve system performance and scalability.    Developed an analytics service for collecting and analyzing task execution data, generating reports, and providing statistics.  
I designed and implemented my own project: an asynchronous Telegram bot that uses aiohttp and the Etherscan API to track Ethereum addresses. The bot provides access to the history of transactions and smart contract events related to the tracked addresses. The entire project was deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, including the use of a PostgreSQL database in the Amazon RDS service for data storage
